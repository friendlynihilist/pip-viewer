        Prag 1) Ms 318 PRAGMATISM. Title: Pragmatism:<lb/>
Mr. Editor: [3] Survey.<lb/>
<lb/>
The philosophical journals, the world over, are just now brimming<lb/>
<add>as you know,</add><lb/>
over with pragmatism and anti pragmatism. The number of <del>Leonardo</del> <add>Leonardo</add> that<lb/>
reaches me this morning has an admirable piece on the subject by a writer<lb/>
of genius and of literary skill, Giovanni Papini. Yesterday brought news<lb/>
of discussions along the same line in New Zealand. Often, however, one hears<lb/>
glib utterances that betray complete misunderstanding of this new ingredient<lb/>
of the thought of our time; so that I gladly accept your invitation<lb/>
to explain what pragmatism really is, how it came into being, and whither it is<lb/>
tending. Any philosophical doctrine that should be completely new could<lb/>
hardly fail to prove completely false; but the rivulets at the head of the river<lb/>
of pragmatism are easily traced back to almost any desired antiquity.

Humane Understanding' (I refuse to reform the spelling,) had been washed out in<lb/>
these same pure springs. It was this medium, and not tar-water, that gave health<lb/>
and strength to Berkeley's earlier works, his 'Theory of Vision' and what remains<lb/>
of his 'Principles'. From it the general views of Kant derive such clearness as<lb/>
they have. Auguste Comte made <del>much more</del> <add>still more</add> use of this element; as<lb/>
much as he saw his way to using. Unfortunately, however, both he and Kant,<lb/>
in their rather opposite ways, were in the habit of mingling <del>the</del> <add>these</add> sparkling waters<lb/>

decidedly British. I, alone of our number, had come upon the<lb/>

a little paper expressing some of the opinions that I had been urging all<lb/>

especially of the starry host of Kant's progeny, in spite of pragmatists' declarations,<lb/>
unanimous, reiterated, and most explicit, still remain unable to 'catch on' to<lb/>
what we are driving at, and persist in twisting our purpose and purport all<lb/>
awry. I was long enough, myself, within the Kantian fold to comprehend their<lb/>
difficulty; but let it go. Suffice it to say once more that pragmatism is, in<lb/>
itself, no doctrine of metaphysics, no attempt to determine any truth of<lb/>

and of abstract concepts. <hi rend="underline" style="color:red">All pragmatists of whatsoever stripe will cordially</hi><lb/>
assent to that statement. As to the ulterior and indirect effects of practising the<lb/>
pragmatistic method, that is quite another affair.<lb/>

meanings of words and concepts is no other than that <hi rend="underline" style="color:red">experimental method</hi>

Beyond these two propositions to which pragmatists assent <hi rend="underline" style="color:black">nem. con.</hi>, we<lb/>

and though we may differ on important questions of philosophy, <del>I am inclined to</del><lb/>

<add>If pragmatism had never been heard of, I believe the opinions of James and of me on the <del>other</del></add><lb/>

<lb/>
I understand pragmatism to be a method of ascertaining the meanings, not<lb/>
of all ideas, but only of what I call "<hi rend="underline" style="color:red">intellectual concepts</hi>," that is to say, of<lb/>
those upon the structure of which arguments concerning objective fact<lb/>
may hinge. Had the light which, as things are, excites in us the sensation<lb/>
of blue, always excited the sensation of red, and <hi rend="underline" style="color:black">vice versa</hi>, however great a<lb/>
difference that might have made in our feelings, it could have made none<lb/>
in the force of any argument. In this respect, the qualities of hard and soft,

        (Prag 11) strikingly contrast with those of red and blue; because while red<lb/>
and blue name mere subjective feelings only, hard and soft <del>have</del> express<lb/>
the factual behaviour of the thing under the pressure of a knife-edge.<lb/>
[I use the word "hard" in its strict mineralogical sense, of "would resist a knife-edge".]<lb/>
My pragmatism, having nothing to do with qualities of feeling, permits<lb/>
me to hold that the predication of such a quality is just what it seems, and<lb/>
has nothing to do with anything else. Hence, could two qualities of feeling<lb/>
everywhere be interchanged, nothing but feelings could be affected.<lb/>
Those qualities have no intrinsic significations beyond themselves.<lb/>

have preferred to state <del>the</del> it problematically, as a surmise to be verified by<lb/>

the fruit of this outgrowth from formal logic, and is worth much more than<lb/>
<add>the small sum total of</add><lb/>
<del>all</del> the rest of my work, as time will show.<lb/>
<lb/>
The next moment of the argument for pragmatism is the view that<lb/>
every thought is a sign. This is the doctrine of Leibniz, Berkeley and<lb/>
<del>other</del> <del>late</del> thinkers of the years about 1700. They were all extreme<lb/>
nominalists; but it is a great mistake to suppose that this doctrine is<lb/>
peculiarly nominalistic. I am myself a scholastic realist of a<lb/>
somewhat extreme stripe. Every realist must, as such, admit that <hi rend="underline" style="color:red">a</hi><lb/>
general is a term and therefore a sign. If, in addition, he holds that it

        <hi rend="encircled"> Prag 24 </hi> is an absolute exemplar, this Platonism passes quite beyond<lb/>
the question of nominalism and realism; and indeed the doctrine of Platonic<lb/>
ideas has been held by the extremest nominalists. There is some reason to<lb/>
suspect that it was shared by Roscellin himself.<lb/>
The next point is still less novel; for not to mention references to it<lb/>
by the Greek commentators upon Aristotle, it was between six and seven<lb/>
centuries ago that John of Salisbury spoke of it as "ferè in<lb/>
omnium ore celebre." It is the distinction, to use that author's<lb/>
phrases, between that which term <hi rend="underline" style="color:black">nominat</hi>, -- its logical breadth, --<lb/>
and that which it <hi rend="underline" style="color:black">significat</hi>, -- its logical depth. In the case of a<lb/>

denotes and that which its predicate asserts. In the case of <del>the</del> an<lb/>

<lb/>
The action of a sign calls for a little closer attention. Let me remind<lb/>
you of the distinction referred to above between dynamical, or dyadic,<lb/>
action; and intelligent, or triadic action. An event A may, by brute<lb/>
force, <del>bring about</del> <add>produce</add> an event, B; and then the event, B, may in its<lb/>
turn <del>bring about</del> <add>produce</add> a third event, C. The fact that the event, C, is<lb/>
about to be produced by B has no influence at all upon the<lb/>
production of B by A. It is impossible that it should, since<lb/>
the action of B in producing C is a contingent future event<lb/>
at the time B is produced. Such is dyadic action, which is so called<lb/>
because each step of it concerns a pair of objects.<lb/>

be drawn between the interpretant and the object. It will be con-<lb/>

question as it applies to <del>the</del> propositions. The interpretant of a proposi-<lb/>

expressed, or as "<add>has</add> either not <add>been</add> burned or shuns fire", or "has not been burned",<lb/>
or "shuns fire", or "shuns", or "is true"; nor is this enumeration exhaustive.<lb/>
But where shall the line be most truly drawn? I reply that the purpose of<lb/>
this sentence being understood to be to communicate information, any<lb/>
thing belongs to the interpretant that describes the quality or character<lb/>
of the fact, anything to the object that, without doing that, distinguishes<lb/>
this fact from others like it; while a third part of the proposition,<lb/>

usually consist merely in a series of feelings. If a sign produces<lb/>
any further proper significate effect, it will do so through the<lb/>
mediation of the emotional interpretant, and such further effect<lb/>
will always involve an effort. I call it the <hi rend="underline" style="color:red">energetic inter-</hi><lb/>

in the fact that, in the end, every sincere inquirer will be led to<lb/>
embrace it; – and if he be not sincere, the irresistible effect of<lb/>
inquiry in the light of experience will be to make him so. This doctrine<lb/>
appears to me, after one subtraction, to be a <del>cons</del> corollary of pragma-<lb/>
tism. I set it in a strong light in my original presentation of the<lb/>

and pragmatically enough. Mr. Schiller's second definition is Captain Bunsby's<lb/>
that "the 'truth' of an assertion depends on its application", which seems to me<lb/>
the result of a weak analysis. His third definition is that pragmatism<lb/>
is the doctrine that "<hi rend="underline" style="color:red">the meaning of a rule lies in its application", which</hi><lb/>

consider themselves as belonging to our school of thought. Their affiliations<lb/>
with us are, however, undeniable. His fifth definition is that pragmatism<lb/>
is the doctrine that "all mental life is purposive". His sixth definition is that<lb/>
pragmatism is "a systematic protest against all ignoring of the purposive-<lb/>
ness of actual knowing." Mr. Schiller seems <add>habitually</add> to use the word "actual" in some<lb/>
peculiar sense. His seventh definition is that pragmatism is "a<lb/>
conscious application to epistemology (or logic) of a teleological<lb/>
psychology, which implies, ultimately, a voluntaristic metaphysic."<lb/>

<lb/>
There are certain questions commonly reckoned as metaphy-<lb/>

reaction-machine are as follows:<lb/>
<lb/>
1st; A reaction-machine is very delicately susceptible, <del>to</del> and in<lb/>
a vast variety of ways, to physical forces; but only provided those<lb/>
forces and their ways of incidence are of very special kinds. <del>For</del> The<lb/>
event of a force being at any time of such a kind and so incident<lb/>
as to affect the reaction-machine is called an <hi rend="underline" style="color:black">excitation</hi>.<lb/>
<lb/>
2nd; The effect upon a reaction-machine of a reaction is a motion, <add>, called a <hi rend="underline" style="color:black">reaction</hi>,</add><lb/>
of some one of a large variety of parts of the machine. There is little<lb/>
persistently regular connection between the quality of an excitation and

        (Prag. 19) that of the resulting reaction. <del>But an</del> <add>a more</add> intense excitation<lb/>
will, other things being equal, produce <del>an</del> <add>a more</add> energetic reaction. The general<lb/>
law of reaction, which is greatly modified by other properties, is that, <add>as long as</add> the<lb/>
excitation continues, the reaction increases in intensity; but when the<lb/>
excitation ceases, the reaction ceases.<lb/>
<lb/>
3<hi rend="underline" style="color:black">rd</hi>; After almost any part or the whole of the reaction-machine has<lb/>
been uninterruptedly in action, for a lapse of time differing enormously<lb/>
for different parts, but always shorter the more intense has been the<lb/>
action, there comes on a temporary, though not usually very brief<lb/>
state, called the <hi rend="underline" style="color:black">fatigue</hi>, of that part, which is marked <add>by two effects;</add> first, by decreased<lb/>
<add>further</add><lb/>
and <add>and</add> decreasing activity; secondly, (especially in reactions and associations) by<lb/>
a tendency of the activity to be transferred to other parts, which may be neigh-<lb/>
boring but dissimilar, or similar but distant, or otherwise related to the parts

        [Pra§ 20] theretofore active. The consequence is that if an excitation<lb/>
continues, the reaction will usually become, for a while, more and<lb/>
more violent, changing its mode several times, until some<lb/>
reactional motion happens to cause the cessation of the motion.<lb/>
But this does not usually happen, because, in consequence of<lb/>
the fourth property of the reaction-machine, the excitation will<lb/>
be brought to an end more promptly.<lb/>
<lb/>
4^a; An excitation, E', that is similar to a previous<lb/>
excitation, E, or to several previous excitations, has a<lb/>
particular tendency to be followed by reactions, R', S', T', etc.<lb/>
that are similar to reactions, R, S, T, etc., that have ensued<lb/>
upon such previous excitations; and this tendency is stronger<lb/>

an unlimited universe of marks, any two <add>individual</add> objects are, in<lb/>

human apprehension of similarity has been developed by<lb/>

purely physical apparatus, and similarities which govern<lb/>
its action must be fundamentally similarities of dyna-<lb/>

<del>ter's</del> <add>own</add> <del>panorama</del> <add>of his own life. Note that statement, for it is the key to my use of the term Object of a sign.</add>. The reason is plain. The utterer's sign can <del>convey</del> <add>embody</add><lb/>
nothing but a bit of the utterer's <add>idea of his own</add> life. <del>Let him try to tell the utterer</del> <add>In attempting to give</add> <add>interpreter</add><lb/>

interpreter's panorama to which he conceives this scrap should<lb/>
be attached and this he expresses in his sign for the interpreter's benefit.<lb/>
